 #Archeology
 
 #Relic world site
 
 site_srelic: "Searching for Answers"
 site_srelic_intro: "This system has many odd features, and this relic world may hold the answers"
 srelic.11.name: "Finding Purpose"
 srelic.11.desc: "It seems that this society never aspired to venture beyond their home system, and instead focused all of their efforts towards one thing: fucking. It seems that they were so focused on sexual gratification that everything else was secondary, and remnants of their fluids can be found all across the planet."
 srelic.12.name: "Library of Pleasures"
 srelic.12.desc: "The archeology team has discovered the remnants of what appears to be a giant library filled with many documents created by the dead civilization. While most of the files are pornographic in nature, it seems that they may have stored more important documents as well."
 srelic.13.name: "The Vault of Glass"
 srelic.13.desc: "While searching through the library, the team found a hidden tunnel that lead to an large underground vault. A majority of the vault is filled floor to ceiling with glass computers holding even more media created by the civilization. It would seem that this holds every work ever created by the civilization. There are various offshoots from the main vault which the team has decided to investigate."
 srelic.14.name: "Outbound Signal"
 srelic.14.desc: "One of the archeologists found that there was a hidden transmitter connected to the large database in the Vault of Glass. The signal it's giving off is entirely foreign and will take some time to decipher, but the team was able to determine that it's receiver is on the shielded moon."
 srelic.15.name: "Signal Deciphered"
 srelic.15.desc: "The archeology team was able to successfully decipher the transmition, and with the discovery of a tranciever discovered that whatever is on the moon is actively accessing the Vault of Glass. The team has reverse-engineered the tranciever and is going to attempt communication with who (or what) is on the shielded moon."
 srelic.15.a: "Perhaps they have answers"
 srelic.16.name: "Contact"
 srelic.16.desc: "Hello?\n\nHoly shit, I haven't recieved communications from this line in thousands of years! Y'all must be aliens right? Damn, gonna be honest I thought y'all would never come."
 srelic.16.a: "Who are you?"
 srelic.16.a.response: "Me? Well I'm a scientist, one of the few of my time. All I've ever wanted to do was go to the moon but nobody else was even slightly interested.\n\n"Why would you want to go there?" they said, "just have sex with us" they said, well FUCK THAT SHIT. I wanted to go to the moon so I went to the damn moon. Turns out this place was just a suitable for life as the main planet, but I knew that if the folks back home knew that they'd be sending people over here like crazy, so I developed the shield that's in place now. Had a few unintended consequences, such as extending my lifespan and not being able to turn it off, but it's been fine other than that."
 srelic.16.b: "What happened to your people?"
 srelic.16.b.response: "Well, it was quite strange really. Their drive for lust was insane, it drove basically every decision they made. This lust was so strong, that it gained the attention of some being from another plane of existence. It made some kind of deal with the folks down there, cause the last transmission I got was just every person on the planet saying "yes" at the same time. When it left, all that remained was an empty planet and a weird purple ball about the size of an astroid; damn thing flew off somewhere but I think it's still in the system."
 srelic.16.c: "You wouldn't happen to have any technology would you?"
 srelic.16.c.response: "Haha, yes of course I do, I am a scientist after all. I just so happen to have quite a few inventions that may be of some use to you, I'll send them over in exchange for access to alien media, cause I've almost ran out of stuff to do here."
 srelic.16.d: "Deal"

 #sring origin site
 
 site_sring: "Breaking Point"
 site_sring_intro: "This segment of ringworld has been completely broken apart by a rogue world, exposing the innards of the structure. Maybe exploring this area will grant us some insight into what the creators of this structure had in mind"
 sring.11.name: "Odd latch"
 sring.11.desc: "While exploring the wreckage, the archeology team found a latch which seems to lead into a rather undamaged section of the ring. It's locked, so it will take some time to get through"
 sring.12.name: "Maze of Infinitude"
 sring.12.desc: "After breaching through the latch, the archeologists found a large maze that stretches in all directions. Control panels are found throughout, perhaps if we can get one working a way can be found to something interesting."
 sring.13.name: "Map of the Maze"
 sring.13.desc: "Once the console was powered back on, a large maze of the structure was found, indicating an area far ahead that holds the data vaults of this ring's builders. The Archeology team is ready to go, but the journey through the maze will take some time."
 sring.14.name: "Server Stacks"
 sring.14.desc: "After some time, we have found the servers. While some are damaged, the archeologists have been able to turn a few on. As of now they are searchig through the archives for information regarding the ring and it's builders. They will contact us when they've found everything they can."
 sring.15.name: "A Horrible Fate"
 sring.15.desc: "The archeology team have found out much about this ring and it's builders from these archives. They initially built the ring for themselves to live on, a new colony for their vast empire. However, they were forced to abandon it after an unknown force only known as "The End" deleted every sentient lifeform in their empire from existence. This is only known because of an AI that continued recording data after they had died. While this AI's data core was destroyed with this ring segment, it left coordinates to various caches before now undiscovered resources."
 sring.15.a: "A tragic fate, we'll use these resources well"
